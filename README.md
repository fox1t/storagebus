### "Storage bus, but for longer trips!"

StorageCoach is a storage abstraction layer for Node.js that removes any difference among multiple public cloud storage services and local filesystems. Thanks to its plugins, it provides basic Key/Value storage functionality and works with Amazon Simple Storage Service, Azure Blob Storage and Google Cloud Storage.
